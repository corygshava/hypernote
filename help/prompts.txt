make me a simple memo creation memo app. this app works by retreiving a list of memos via an API call to '_api/getmemos' which returns memos in the form of a json string [{"name":"what","data":"(memo contents)"},"datecreated":"(just a date)","expiry":(another date)]. make it also have some demo text it shows if no memos are found. make the page have a button for adding a memo which opens a modal with a form that sends data to _api/addmemos. the form has 3 inputs. one for memo title, a textarea for memo message and a password input for access key. make it that the modal closes when someone clicks outside of it. make it be a darkmode app with an orange theme color

make me a php code that will accept the data from the form. then check if all the necessary fields have been passed, then check if the accesskey is "strong_passwird" and if it is it reads a JSON file appdata.json, and appends the array of its contents (or creates a new one if absent) in the form {name: passed name,data: value of textarea,datecreated: current date and time,expiry: every memo expires after 3 days} then make it send the result if it was either successful or if any error happened

now for the php file that will read the json file and relay the results back to the user
